We will be using jupyter notebook workflows but within python code. All
the markdown that we would have to manually enter in jupyter lab or in 
the notebooks directly will live as comments in our python scripts. 

To convert the code to jupyter notebooks we'll use jupytext. An awesome
python library that takes care of that and can even execute and render
notebooks, html or even pdfs (using pandoc and LaTeX for the latter).

Most of the documentation should live within the code since they even 
support the use of LaTeX equations in comments.
